# 🎤 Talks & Slides

Welcome!  
This repository gathers all the **slides** from my past tech talks, presented at various conferences (e.g. JUG Summer Camp, Touraine Tech, and others).

## 📚 Content

Each folder contains:
- The slides (PDF).
- Sometimes code samples or additional resources.
- A `README.md` with details about the talk (abstract, context, useful links).

## 🗓️ Conferences

A non-exhaustive list of events where these talks were presented:

## 🎯 Purpose

The goal of this repository is to:
